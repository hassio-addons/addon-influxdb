Scalable datastore for metrics, events, and real-time analytics.

## About

InfluxDB is an open source time series database optimized for high-write-volume.
It's useful for recording metrics, sensor data, events,
and performing analytics. It exposes an HTTP API for client interaction and is
often used in combination with Grafana to visualize the data.

This add-on comes with Chronograf & Kapacitor pre-installed as well. Which
gives you a nice InfluxDB admin interface for managing your users, databases,
data retention settings, and lets you peek inside the database using the
Data Explorer.

## Installation

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and not different in
comparison to installing any other Home Assistant add-on.

1. Search for the "InfluxDB" add-on in the Supervisor add-on store and install it.
1. Start the "InfluxDB" add-on.
1. Check the logs of the "InfluxDB" to see if everything went well.
1. Click the "OPEN WEB UI" button!

## Configuration

**Note**: _Remember to restart the add-on when the configuration is changed._

Example add-on configuration:

```yaml
log_level: info
auth: true
reporting: true
ssl: true
certfile: fullchain.pem
keyfile: privkey.pem
envvars:
  - name: INFLUXDB_HTTP_LOG_ENABLED
    value: 'true'
```

**Note**: _This is just an example, don't copy and paste it! Create your own!_

### Option: `log_level`

The `log_level` option controls the level of log output by the addon and can
be changed to be more or less verbose, which might be useful when you are
dealing with an unknown issue. Possible values are:

- `trace`: Show every detail, like all called internal functions.
- `debug`: Shows detailed debug information.
- `info`: Normal (usually) interesting events.
- `warning`: Exceptional occurrences that are not errors.
- `error`:  Runtime errors that do not require immediate action.
- `fatal`: Something went terribly wrong. Add-on becomes unusable.

Please note that each level automatically includes log messages from a
more severe level, e.g., `debug` also shows `info` messages. By default,
the `log_level` is set to `info`, which is the recommended setting unless
you are troubleshooting.

### Option: `auth`

Enable or disable InfluxDB user authentication.

**Note**: _Turning this off is NOT recommended!_

### Option: `reporting`

This option allows you to disable the reporting of usage data to InfluxData.

**Note**: _No data from user databases is ever transmitted!_

### Option: `ssl`

Enables/Disables SSL (HTTPS) on the web interface.
Set it `true` to enable it, `false` otherwise.

**Note**: _This does NOT activate SSL for InfluxDB, just the web interface_

### Option: `certfile`

The certificate file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `keyfile`

The private key file to use for SSL.

**Note**: _The file MUST be stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default_

### Option: `envvars`

This allows the setting of Environment Variables to control InfluxDB
configuration as documented at:

 <https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.7/administration/config/#configuration-settings>

**Note**: _Changing these options can possibly cause issues with you instance.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

These are case sensitive.

#### Sub-option: `name`

The name of the environment variable to set which must start with `INFLUXDB_`

#### Sub-option: `value`

The value of the environment variable to set, set the Influx documentation for
full details.

### Option: `leave_front_door_open`

Adding this option to the add-on configuration allows you to disable
authentication on the Web Terminal by setting it to `true` and leaving the
username and password empty.

**Note**: _We STRONGLY suggest, not to use this, even if this add-on is
only exposed to your internal network. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!_

## Integrating into Home Assistant

The `influxdb` integration of Home Assistant makes it possible to transfer all
state changes to an InfluxDB database.

You need to do the following steps in order to get this working:

- Click on "OPEN WEB UI" to open the admin web-interface provided by this add-on.
- On the left menu click on the "InfluxDB Admin".
- Create a database for storing Home Assistant's data in, e.g., `homeassistant`.
- Goto the users tab and create a user for Home Assistant,
  e.g., `homeassistant`.

Now we've got this in place, add the following snippet to your Home Assistant
`configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
influxdb:
  host: a0d7b954-influxdb
  port: 8086
  database: homeassistant
  username: homeassistant
  password: <yourpassword>
  max_retries: 3
  default_measurement: state
```

Restart Home Assistant.

You should now see the data flowing into InfluxDB by visiting the web-interface
and using the Data Explorer.

## Known issues and limitations

- While the Chronograph interface supports SSL, currently, the add-on does
  not support having SSL on InfluxDB. This limitation is caused by
  Chronograf and we are still looking into a proper solution for this.
